[Verse 1]
Livin' easy
Lovin' free
Season ticket on a one way ride
Askin' nothin'
Leave me be
Takin' everythin' in my stride
Don't need reason
Don't need rhyme
Ain't nothin' I’d rather do
Goin' down
Party time
My friends are gonna be there too, yeah

I'm on the highway to hell
On the highway to hell
Highway to hell

Speed limit
Nobody's gonna slow me down
Like a wheel
Gonna spin it
Nobody's gonna mess me around
Hey Satan
Payin' my dues
Playin' in a rocking band
Hey mama
Look at me
I'm on the way to the promised land

[Verse 1]
I was caught in the middle of a railroad track (Thunder)
I looked 'round and I knew there was no turning back (Thunder)
My mind raced and I thought, what could I do? (Thunder)
And I knew there was no help, no help from you (Thunder)
Sound of the drums beating in my heart
The thunder of guns tore me apart
[Refrain]
You've been - thunderstruck
[Verse 2]
Went down the highway, 
broke the limit, we hit the town
Went through to Texas, Yeah, Texas, and we had some fun
We met some girls, some dancers who gave a good time
Broke all the rules, played all the fools
Yeah-yeah, they, they, they blew our minds[Pre-Chorus]
I was shaking at the knees
Could I come again please?
Yeah, the ladies were too kind
[Chorus]
You've been - thunderstruck, thunderstruck
Yeah-yeah-yeah, thunderstruck
Oh, thunderstruck

[Verse 1]
She was a fast machine, she kept her motor clean
She was the best damn woman that I ever seen
She had the sightless eyes, telling me no lies
Knocking me out with those American thighs
Taking more than her share, had me fighting for air
She told me to come, but I was already there
'Cause the walls start shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it
[Chorus]
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
[Verse 2]
Working double-time on the seduction line
She's one of a kind, she's just a-mine all mine
Wanted no applause, 
just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it
[Chorus]
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long
It knocked me out that
You shook me all night long
It had me shaking
And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Well, you took me[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
You really took me and
You shook me all night long
Ah, you shook me all night long
Yeah, yeah, you shook me all night long
You really got me and you, shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me
Yeah, you shook me
All night long
[Verse 1]
Back in black
, 
I hit the sack
I've been too long, I'm glad to be back
Yes, I'm let loose from the noose
That's kept me hangin' about
I'm just a-lookin' at the sky 'cause it's gettin' me high
Forget the hearse, 'cause I'll never die
I got nine lives, cat's eyes
Abusin' every one of them and runnin' wild
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back, back

[Verse 2]
Oh, back in the back of a Cadillac
Number one with a bullet,
 I'm a power pack
Yes, I'm in a bang, ooh, with a gang
They've got to catch me if they want me to hang
'Cause I'm back on the track and I'm beatin' the flack
Nobody's gonna get me on another rap
So, look at me now, I'm just a-makin' my play
Don't try to push your luck, just get outta my way[Chorus]
'Cause I'm back
Yes, I'm back
Well, I'm back
