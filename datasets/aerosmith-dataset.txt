[Verse 1]
Every time​ that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay, yeah
[Interlude]
I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win
[Verse 2]
Half my life's in books' written pages
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the feelings come back to you
[Chorus]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
[Bridge]
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dreams come true
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dreams come true
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, ah!
[Chorus]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
[Verse 1]
Backstroke lover
Always hidin' 'neath the covers
'Til I talked to your daddy, he say
He said, "You ain't seen nothin'
'Til you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changin' your ways"
I met a cheerleader
Was a real young bleeder
Oh, the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of lovin'
With her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss
Like this
[Pre-Chorus]
Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singing, hey diddle diddle
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
And I know love was here to stay
When she told me to[Chorus]
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Just give me a kiss
[Guitar Solo]
[Post-Chorus]
Like this
[Verse 2]
Schoolgirl sweetie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up the knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss
Like this[Pre-Chorus]
Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singing, hey diddle diddle
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to
[Chorus]
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
Just give me a kiss

[Intro]
Come here, baby
You know you drive me up a wall?
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems you got somethin' on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me?
[Verse 1]
Say you're leavin' on a seven thirty train
And that you're headin' out to Hollywood
Girl, you've been givin' me that line so many times
It kinda gets like feelin' bad looks good, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
That kinda loving turns a man to a slave
That kinda loving sends a man right to his grave
[Chorus]
I go crazy, crazy
Baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
What can I do, honey?
I feel like the color blue[Verse 2]
You're packing up your stuff and talking like it's tough
And tryin' to tell me that it's time to go, yeah!
But I know you ain't wearing nothing underneath that overcoat
And it's all a show, yeah!
[Pre-Chorus]
That kind of loving
Makes me want to pull down the shade, yeah!
That kind of loving
Yeah, now I'm never, never, never, never gonna be the same
[Chorus]
I go crazy, crazy
Baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me crazy, crazy
Crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
What can I do, honey?
I feel like the color blue
[Bridge]
I'm losin' my mind
Girl, 'cause I'm going crazy[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
I need your love, honey, yeah!
I need your love
[Chorus]
Crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
I'm losing my mind
Girl, 'cause I'm going crazy
Crazy, crazy
Crazy for you, baby
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah, you drive me

[Chorus]
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion
[Verse 1]
Talk about things that nobody cares
Wearing other things that nobody wears
You're calling my name but I got to make clear
I can't say baby where I'll be in a year
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
Some sweat hog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go, musta got up and went
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar
‘Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire
[Chorus]
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion[Verse 3]
I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me because the rabbit done died, yes it did
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4]
You stand in the front just a shaking your ass
I'll take you backstage you can drink from my glass
I'll talk about something you can sure understand
'Cause a month on the road and I'll be eating from your hand
[Instrumental Outro]
[Verse 1]
There was a time
When I was so broken-hearted
Luck wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
'Cause me and them ways have parted
That kind of love was the killin' kind
[Pre-Chorus]
So listen
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed
[Chorus]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do down on me, yeah!
[Bridge]
Now there's not even breathing room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah, you cry when we're making love
Must be one and the same[Verse 2]
It's down on me
Yeah, I got to tell you one thing
That's been on my mind, girl, I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You got that certain somethin'
What you give to me takes my breath away
[Pre-Chorus]
Now the word out on the street
Is the devil's in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
It's a fire I can't resist
[Chorus]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do to me, yeah!
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
'Cause what you got inside
Ain't where your love should stay
Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love
'Til you give your heart away[Chorus]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' to let you
Do what you do, what you do down to
No, no, baby, baby, baby
[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do down to
(Down to, baby, down to, down to)
[Outro]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm dyin' to forget you

That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady

[Verse 1]
Cruise into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
She's a long lost love at first bite
Baby, maybe you're wrong, but you know it's all right
That's right
[Interlude]
That, that
That, that
[Verse 2]
Backstage, we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody said
"Forgive me if I seem out of line"
And she whipped out a gun and tried to blow me away
[Chorus]
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady[Verse 3]
Never judge a book by its cover
Or who you gonna love by your lover
Sayin' love put me wise to her love in disguise
She had the body of a Venus
, Lord, imagine my surprise
[Chorus]
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady

[Verse 1]
I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through the pain
When I lost my grip, and I hit the floor
Yeah, I thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired of livin' a lie
I was wishin that I would die
[Chorus]
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
[Bridge]
That one last shot's a
 
permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey, not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings[Verse 2]
You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah
I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive
[Chorus]
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
Desperate hearts, desperate hearts....
[Solo]
[Outro: Spoken]
"So from all of us at Aerosmith to all of you out there, wherever you are, remember: the light at the end of the tunnel may be you. Good night."
[Verse 1]
I'm alone
Yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears
And the cryin' that I do is for you
[Pre-Chorus]
I want your love, let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough, I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough, I've suffered and I've seen the light
[Chorus]
Baby, you're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
[Verse 2]
Don't know what I'm gonna do
About this feeling inside
Yes it's true
Loneliness took me for a ride, yeah, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Without your love I'm nothing but a beggar
Without your love, a dog without a bone
What can I do? I'm sleeping in this bed alone[Chorus]
Baby, you're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
Come and save me tonight
[Bridge]
You're the reason I live
You're the reason I die
You're the reason I give
When I break down and cry
Don't need no reason why
Baby, baby
[Chorus]
Baby, you're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
You're my angel
Come and save me tonight (Angel)
You're my angel
Come and take me, alright
[Outro]
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
[Verse 1]
Dum, dum, dum, honey, what have you done?
Dum, dum, dum, it's the sound of my gun
Dum, dum, dum, honey, what have you done?
Dum, dum, dum, it's the sound
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Whole world's come undone
From lookin' straight at the sun
What did her daddy do?
What did he put you through?
[Verse 2]
They said when Janie was arrested
They found him underneath a train
But, man, he had it comin'
Now that Janie's got a gun
She ain't never gonna be the same
[Chorus 2]
Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Her 
dog day
's just begun
Now everybody is on the run
Tell me now it's untrue
What did her daddy do?
He jacked a little bitty baby
The man has got to be insane
They say the spell that he was under
The lightning and
 the thunder
Knew that someone had to stop the rain[Chorus 3]
Run away, run away from the pain, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away from the pain, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away, run, run away
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus 2]
Janie got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run
[Verse 2]
What did her daddy do?
It's Janie's last I.O.U
She had to take him down easy and put a bullet in his brain
She said, "'Cause nobody believes me. The man was such a sleeze
He ain't never gonna be the same"
[Chorus 3]
Run away, run away from the pain, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away from the pain, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away, run, run away[Chorus 2]
Janie's got a gun

Janie's got a gun
Now everybody is on the run
[Outro]
Janie got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run (Honey, honey, what's the problem?)
Because Janie got a gun (Tell me it ain't right)
Janie got a gun 
(Was it Daddy's cradle robbing that)
Her dog day's just begun 
(Made you scream at night?)
Now everybody is on the run
Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run
