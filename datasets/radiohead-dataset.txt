[Verse 1]
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
[Chorus]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
[Verse 2]
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
[Pre-Chorus]
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special[Chorus]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Oh-oh, oh-oh
[Bridge]
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
[Outro]
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
[Verse 1]
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
[Chorus]
And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent
[Verse 2]
This is my final fit
My final bellyache with
[Chorus]
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
[Verse 3]
Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden[Chorus]
No alarms and no surprises
(Get me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises
(Get me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises, please
(Get me out of here)
[Verse 1]
Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
[Verse 2]
Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party
[Chorus]
This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
When you mess with us
[Verse 3]
Karma police, I've given all I can, it's not enough
I've given all I can, but we're still on the payroll
[Chorus]
This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
When you mess with us[Outro]
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
[Verse 1]
Two jumps in a week, I bet you
Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not
[Chorus]
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
[Verse 2]
Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out[Chorus]
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing you've had has gone away
[Chorus]
So don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
[Verse 1]
Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back in focus again
The walls are bending shape
They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose
[Verse 2]
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes 'round and 'round
The beat goes 'round and 'round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance[Chorus]
A jigsaw falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, and you look back
Not just once, and not just twice
Wish away your nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You got the light, you can feel it on your back
A light, you can feel it on your back
Your jigsaw falling into place
[Verse 1]
Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape, we escape
[Verse 2]
Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose
[Verse 3]
Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone
[Verse 4]
Sing us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill
Such a chill
[Verse 5]
And you can laugh a spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace
We hope that you choke, that you choke[Outro]
We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke
[Verse 1]
A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In a fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plants
To get rid of itself
[Chorus]
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
[Verse 2]
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins
[Chorus]
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears[Verse 3]
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run
[Chorus]
And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
[Outro]
And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time
All the time
[Verse 1]
Can't get the stink off
He's been hanging 'round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends
[Pre-Chorus 1]
One day he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow
[Chorus]
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
[Verse 2]
Don't get my sympathy
Hanging out the fifteenth floor
You've changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door
[Pre-Chorus 2]
One day I'll get to you
And teach you how to get to purest hell[Chorus]
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Self
[Outro]
(You do it to yourself!)
(You do it to yourself!)
(Oh, you do it to yourself!)
(Oh, you do it to yourself!)
[Verse 1]
In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?
[Verse 2]
I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me into phantoms (Way out)
I follow to the edge (Way out)
Of the earth (Way out)
And fall off
Yeah, everybody leaves (Way out)
If they get the chance (Way out)
And this (Way out)
Is my chance
[Chorus]
I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
Yeah, I
I hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
I
I hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
[Verse 1]
I'm the next act waiting in the wings
I'm an animal trapped in your hot car
I am all the days that you choose to ignore
[Chorus]
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
[Verse 2]
I am a moth who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you because there are no others
[Chorus]
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
[Outro]
It's all wrong, it's all wrong, it's all wrong
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's all wrong, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright
