[Verse 1]
Every time​ that I look in the mirror
All these lines on my face getting clearer
The past is gone
It went by like dusk to dawn
Isn't that the way?
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay, yeah
[Interlude]
I know nobody knows
Where it comes and where it goes
I know it's everybody's sin
You got to lose to know how to win
[Verse 2]
Half my life's in books' written pages
Lived and learned from fools and from sages
You know it's true
All the feelings come back to you
[Chorus]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
[Bridge]
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dreams come true
Dream on, dream on, dream on
Dream until your dreams come true
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, dream on
Dream on, ah!
[Chorus]
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
[Verse 1]
Backstroke lover
Always hidin' 'neath the covers
'Til I talked to your daddy, he say
He said, "You ain't seen nothin'
'Til you're down on a muffin
Then you're sure to be a-changin' your ways"
I met a cheerleader
Was a real young bleeder
Oh, the times I could reminisce
'Cause the best things of lovin'
With her sister and her cousin
Only started with a little kiss
Like this
[Pre-Chorus]
Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singing, hey diddle diddle
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
And I know love was here to stay
When she told me to[Chorus]
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Just give me a kiss
[Guitar Solo]
[Post-Chorus]
Like this
[Verse 2]
Schoolgirl sweetie with the classy kinda sassy
Little skirt's climbin' way up the knee
There was three young ladies in the school gym locker
When I noticed they was lookin' at me
I was a high school loser, never made it with a lady
'Til the boys told me somethin' I missed
Then my next door neighbor with a daughter had a favor
So I gave her just a little kiss
Like this[Pre-Chorus]
Seesaw swingin' with the boys in the school
And your feet flyin' up in the air
Singing, hey diddle diddle
With your kitty in the middle
Of the swing like you didn't care
So I took a big chance
At the high school dance
With a missy who was ready to play
Wasn't me she was foolin'
'Cause she knew what she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to
[Chorus]
Walk this way
Talk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Walk this way
Talk this way
Just give me a kiss

[Intro]
Come here, baby
You know you drive me up a wall?
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull
Seems like we're makin' up more than we're makin' love
And it always seems you got somethin' on your mind other than me
Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me?
[Verse 1]
Say you're leavin' on a seven thirty train
And that you're headin' out to Hollywood
Girl, you've been givin' me that line so many times
It kinda gets like feelin' bad looks good, yeah

That kinda loving sends a man right to his grave

And tryin' to tell me that it's time to go, yeah!
But I know you ain't wearing nothing underneath that overcoat
And it's all a show, yeah!

That kind of loving
Makes me want to pull down the shade, yeah!
That kind of loving
Yeah, now I'm never, never, never, never gonna be the same

Talk about things that nobody cares
Wearing other things that nobody wears
You're calling my name but I got to make clear
I can't say baby where I'll be in a year
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 2]
Some sweat hog mama with a face like a gent
Said my get up and go, musta got up and went
Well I got good news, she's a real good liar
‘Cause the backstage boogie set your pants on fire
[Chorus]
Sweet emotion
Sweet emotion[Verse 3]
I pulled into town in a police car
Your daddy said I took it just a little too far
You're telling me things but your girlfriend lied
You can't catch me because the rabbit done died, yes it did
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 4]
You stand in the front just a shaking your ass
I'll take you backstage you can drink from my glass
I'll talk about something you can sure understand
'Cause a month on the road and I'll be eating from your hand
[Instrumental Outro]
[Verse 1]
There was a time
When I was so broken-hearted
Luck wasn't much of a friend of mine
The tables have turned, yeah
'Cause me and them ways have parted
That kind of love was the killin' kind
[Pre-Chorus]
So listen
All I want is someone I can't resist
I know all I need to know by the way that I got kissed
[Chorus]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do down on me, yeah!
[Bridge]
Now there's not even breathing room
Between pleasure and pain
Yeah, you cry when we're making love
Must be one and the same[Verse 2]
It's down on me
Yeah, I got to tell you one thing
That's been on my mind, girl, I gotta say
We're partners in crime
You got that certain somethin'
What you give to me takes my breath away
[Pre-Chorus]
Now the word out on the street
Is the devil's in your kiss
If our love goes up in flames
It's a fire I can't resist
[Chorus]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' 'cause I let you
Do what you do to me, yeah!
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
'Cause what you got inside
Ain't where your love should stay
Yeah, our love, sweet love, ain't love
'Til you give your heart away[Chorus]
I was cryin' when I met you
Now I'm tryin' to forget you
Your love is sweet misery
I was cryin' just to get you
Now I'm dyin' to let you

[Verse 1]
Cruise into a bar on the shore
Her picture graced the grime on the door
She's a long lost love at first bite
Baby, maybe you're wrong, but you know it's all right
That's right
[Interlude]
That, that
That, that
[Verse 2]
Backstage, we're having the time
Of our lives until somebody said
"Forgive me if I seem out of line"
And she whipped out a gun and tried to blow me away
[Chorus]
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady[Verse 3]
Never judge a book by its cover
Or who you gonna love by your lover
Sayin' love put me wise to her love in disguise
She had the body of a Venus
, Lord, imagine my surprise
[Chorus]
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady
That, that dude looks like a lady

[Verse 1]
I kept the right ones out
And let the wrong ones in
Had an angel of mercy to see me through all my sins
There were times in my life
When I was goin' insane
Tryin' to walk through the pain
When I lost my grip, and I hit the floor
Yeah, I thought I could leave but couldn't get out the door
I was so sick and tired of livin' a lie
I was wishin that I would die
[Chorus]
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
[Bridge]
That one last shot's a
 
permanent vacation
And how high can you fly with broken wings?
Life's a journey, not a destination
And I just can't tell just what tomorrow brings[Verse 2]
You have to learn to crawl
Before you learn to walk
But I just couldn't listen to all that righteous talk, oh yeah
I was out on the street
Just tryin' to survive
Scratchin' to stay alive
[Chorus]
It's amazing
With the blink of an eye you finally see the light
It's amazing
When the moment arrives that you know you'll be alright
It's amazing
And I'm sayin' a prayer for the desperate hearts tonight
Desperate hearts, desperate hearts....
[Solo]
[Outro: Spoken]
"So from all of us at Aerosmith to all of you out there, wherever you are, remember: the light at the end of the tunnel may be you. Good night."
[Verse 1]
I'm alone
Yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears
And the cryin' that I do is for you
[Pre-Chorus]
I want your love, let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough, I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough, I've suffered and I've seen the light
[Chorus]
Baby, you're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
[Verse 2]
Don't know what I'm gonna do
About this feeling inside
Yes it's true
Loneliness took me for a ride, yeah, yeah
[Pre-Chorus]
Without your love I'm nothing but a beggar
Without your love, a dog without a bone
What can I do? I'm sleeping in this bed alone[Chorus]
Baby, you're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
Come and save me tonight
[Bridge]
You're the reason I live
You're the reason I die
You're the reason I give
When I break down and cry
Don't need no reason why
Baby, baby
[Chorus]
Baby, you're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right
You're my angel
Come and save me tonight (Angel)
You're my angel
Come and take me, alright
[Outro]
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
Come and save me tonight
[Verse 1]
Dum, dum, dum, honey, what have you done?
Dum, dum, dum, it's the sound of my gun
Dum, dum, dum, honey, what have you done?
Dum, dum, dum, it's the sound
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Whole world's come undone
From lookin' straight at the sun
What did her daddy do?
What did he put you through?
[Verse 2]
They said when Janie was arrested
They found him underneath a train
But, man, he had it comin'
Now that Janie's got a gun
She ain't never gonna be the same
[Chorus 2]
Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Her 
dog day
's just begun
Now everybody is on the run
Tell me now it's untrue
What did her daddy do?
He jacked a little bitty baby
The man has got to be insane
They say the spell that he was under
The lightning and
 the thunder
Knew that someone had to stop the rain[Chorus 3]
Run away, run away from the pain, yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away from the pain, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away, run, run away
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus 2]
Janie got a gun
Janie's got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run
[Verse 2]
What did her daddy do?
It's Janie's last I.O.U
She had to take him down easy and put a bullet in his brain
She said, "'Cause nobody believes me. The man was such a sleeze
He ain't never gonna be the same"
[Chorus 3]
Run away, run away from the pain, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away from the pain, yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Run away, run away, run, run away[Chorus 2]
Janie's got a gun

Janie's got a gun
Now everybody is on the run
[Outro]
Janie got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run (Honey, honey, what's the problem?)
Because Janie got a gun (Tell me it ain't right)
Janie got a gun 
(Was it Daddy's cradle robbing that)
Her dog day's just begun 
(Made you scream at night?)
Now everybody is on the run
Janie got a gun
Janie got a gun
Her dog day's just begun
Now everybody is on the run

[Verse 1]
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I'll wait for you
[Verse 2]
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I'll wait without you
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you
[Verse 3]
Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all, but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, ah-hah
I can't live
With or without you
[Refrain]
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away[Verse 4]
My hands are tied
My body bruised
She got me with
Nothing to win and nothing left to lose
[Refrain]
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, oh-oh
I can't live
With or without you
[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh

With or without you
With or without you, oh-oh
I can't live with or without you
With or without you[Outro]
Hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh
Hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh
[Verse 1]
I have climbed highest mountain
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you
[Chorus]
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
[Verse 2]
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing fingertips
It burned like fire
This burnin' desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone
[Chorus]
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still runnin'
You broke the bonds and you loosened the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believe it
[Chorus]
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
[Verse 1]
The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace
[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
[Verse 2]
You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud
, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you
[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo[Post-Chorus]
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case
[Bridge]
See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out
[Chorus]
It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day
[Post-Chorus]
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case[Outro]
What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
Was a beautiful day
[Verse 1]
Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you
Now you got someone to blame?
[Chorus]
You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it
[Verse 2]
Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without
[Chorus]
Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One
[Verse 3]
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?[Chorus]
Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again
[Bridge]
You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt
[Chorus]
One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One
One
[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh
Baby, baby, baby
Higher
Oh, higher (Baby, yeah, yeah)
Higher (Oh)

Go to Sunday Bloody Sunday for music lyrics
[Intro]
Ooh ooh ooh
Yeah yeah yeah
[Verse 1]
My love, she throws me like a rubber ball
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
But she won't catch me or break my fall
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
Baby got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a raincloud
You know she likes a dry kind of love
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
[Chorus]
I'm losin' you, yeah heh hey
I'm losin' you, yeah
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
[Verse 2]
I wanted to run but she made me crawl
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
Eternal fire, she turned me to straw
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
You know I got black eyes
But they burn so brightly for her
Mine is a blind kind of love
(Oh, the sweetest thing)[Chorus]
I'm losin' you, oh oh oh
I'm losin' you, yeah
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
Oh ho, yeah
[Bridge]
Oh oh now now my baby
Um my my, um my baby
Um my my, um my baby
[Verse 3]
Blue-eyed boy and this brown-eyed girl
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
You can sew it up, but you still see the tear
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
And in this, I'm a raincloud
You know we got a stormy kind of love
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, the sweetest thing
Oh, the sweetest thing
Oh, the sweetest thing
[Verse 1]
I'm not afraid
Of anything in this world
There's nothing you can throw at me
That I haven't already heard
I'm just trying to find
A decent melody
A song that I can sing
In my own company
[Pre-Chorus]
I never thought you were a fool
But darling look at you (Oh)
You gotta stand up straight
Carry your own weight
These tears are going nowhere, baby
[Chorus]
You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And now you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
[Verse 2]
I will not forsake
The colours that you bring
The nights you filled with fireworks
They left you with nothing
I am still enchanted
By the light you brought to me
I listen through your ears
Through your eyes I can see[Pre-Chorus]
And you are such a fool
To worry like you do (Oh, oh)
I know it's tough
And you can never get enough
Of what you don't really need now
My, oh my
[Chorus]
You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
Oh love, look at you now
You've got yourself stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
[Bridge]
I was unconscious, half-asleep
The water is warm till you discover how deep
I wasn't jumping, for me it was a fall
It's a long way down to nothing at all
[Chorus]
You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it[Outro]
And if the night runs over
And if the day won't last
And if our way should falter
Along the stony pass
And if the night runs over
And if the day won't last
And if your way should falter
Along the stony pass
It's just a moment
This time will pass
[Intro]
Unos, dos, tres, catorce!
(Turn it up loud, captain)
[Verse 1]
Lights go down, it's dark
The jungle is your head, can't rule your heart
A feeling so much stronger than a thought
Your eyes are wide
And though your soul, it can't be bought
Your mind can wander
[Chorus]
Hello, hello (¡Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (¿Dónde está?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something I can feel
Feel
[Verse 2]
The night is full of holes
As bullets rip the sky of ink with gold
They twinkle as the boys play rock and roll
They know that they can't dance
At least they know
I can't stand the beats, I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music, swinging to the music
Oh, oh, oh[Chorus]
Hello, hello (¡Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (¿Dónde está?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
But you give me something I can feel
Feel
[Post-Chorus]
Checkmated!
Just fun!
She made it in, yeah!
[Bridge]
All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
Just give me what I want and no one gets hurt
[Chorus]
Hello, hello (¡Hola!)
We're at a place called Vertigo (¿Dónde está?)
Lights go down and all I know
Is that you give me something
I can feel your love teaching me how
Your love is teaching me how
How to kneel
Kneel[Outro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Intro]
Once upon a time, not so long ago
[Verse 1]
Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love
[Pre-Chorus]
She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"
[Chorus]
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
[Verse 2]
Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in, 
when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay
Someday"[Pre-Chorus]
We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot
[Chorus]
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer, livin' on a prayer
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Ooh, we gotta hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got
[Chorus]
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
[Intro]
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darling, you give love a bad name
[Verse 1]
An angel's smile is what you sell
You promised me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free
[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, you're a loaded gun, yeah
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done
[Chorus]
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
Yeah, you give love a bad name
[Verse 2]
Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, you're a loaded gun
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done
[Chorus]
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
You give love a—
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Oh, shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
[Outro]
You give love
You give love, bad name
You give love
You give love, bad name
You give love
You give love, bad name
You give love
You give love, bad name
[Verse 1]
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted (woah oh, woah oh, oh)
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud
[Chorus]
It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
[Verse 2]
This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks
[Chorus]
It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life[Bridge]
Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down
[Chorus]
It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
[Verse 1]
This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me
[Chorus]
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always
[Verse 2]
Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine
To say to you 'till the end of time[Chorus]
Yeah, I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
[Bridge]
If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you
[Guitar Solo]
Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines
[Chorus]
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always
Always
[Verse 1]
It's all the same, only the names will change
Every day it seems we're wastin' away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home
[Chorus]
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone, well, all you do is think
[Chorus]
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
Wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, and I ride[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Ooh, I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
[Verse 3]
But I walk these streets, a loaded six-string on my back
I play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back
I've been everywhere, (Oh yeah) still I'm standin' tall
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse, I ride
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
And I'm a cowboy
I got the night on my side
And I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
[Outro]
And I ride (And I ride), dead or alive
I still drive (Still drive), dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
[Verse 1]
On the street where you live girls talk about their social lives
They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes
(All your life) All your life all you've asked when's your daddy gonna talk to you
But you was living in another world trying to get your message through
[Pre-Chorus]
No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head
[Chorus]
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway
[Verse 2]
Take a line every night guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets, calling for a wild time
So you sit home alone cause there's nothing left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you
You know she likes the lights at night on the neon Broadway signs
She don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find
[Chorus]
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head
[Chorus]
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy’s girl learned fast
Now she works the night away
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy’s girl learned fast
Now she works the night away
Ooh, she's a little runaway
[Verse 1]
Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause 
a bottle of Vodka is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead
[Verse 2]
With an ironclad fist, I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need
[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I wanna be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses
[Verse 3]
Well I'm so far away, that each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby, blind love is true[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses
[Bridge]
Well, this hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died
Ooh yeah
[Guitar solo]
[Verse 4]
Now as you close your eyes know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight, I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove for it's you that I'd die to defend[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses
[Chorus]
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad medicine)
[Verse 1]
I ain't got a fever got a permanent disease
It'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms count them, one, two, three
[Pre-Chorus]
First you need (That's what you get for falling in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little but it's never enough)
On your knees (That's what you get for falling in love)
And now this boy's addicted cause your kiss is the drug
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad, bad medicine)[Verse 2]
I don't need no needle to be giving me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addiction, it doesn't leave a track
I've got a jones for your affection like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack
[Pre-Chorus]
When you need (That's what you get for falling in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little but it's never enough)
On your knees (That's what you get for falling in love)
Now this boy is addicted and your kiss is the drug
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
So let's play doctor, baby, cure my disease
(Bad, bad medicine) That's what I want
(Bad, bad medicine) That's what I need
[Verse 3]
I need a respirator cause I'm running out of breath
You're an all night generator wrapped in stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine you take what you can get
'Cause if there's something better baby well they haven't found it yet[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
Your love, bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
Your love's the potion that can cure my disease
Bad, bad medicine is what I want
Bad, bad medicine (I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta)
[Breakdown]
I gotta, I gotta
I gotta do it again, wait a minute, wait a minute
Hold on
I'm not done
One more time
With feeling
Come on
Help me out now
[Chorus]
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up just like bad medicine
You got the potion that can cure my disease
Your love, bad medicine
Your kiss is what I need
Your love, bad medicine
[Verse 1]
I guess this time you're really leavin'
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well, as my broken heart lies bleedin'
You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimmin' for the shore
You left me drownin' in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I'm prayin' to God you'll give me one more chance, girl
[Chorus]
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you
[Verse 2]
I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hidin' place
Well, I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday
And, baby, you know my hands are dirty
(And baby, you know my hands are dirty)
But I wanted to be your Valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine[Chorus]
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
And I wasn't there when you were happy
(And I wasn't there to make you happy)
I wasn't there when you were down
I didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out
[Chorus]
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you
[Outro]
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh-whoa
[Verse 1]
As I sit in this smoky room
The night about to end
I pass my time with strangers
But this bottle's my only friend
Rememberin' when we used to park
On Butler Street out in the dark
Remember when we lost the keys
And you lost more than that in my backseat, baby
[Pre-Chorus]
Remember how we used to talk
About bustin' out, we'd break their hearts
Together forever
[Chorus]
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hopin' it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we've gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
[Verse 2]
Remember days of skippin' school
Racin' cars and bein' cool
With a six-pack and the radio
We didn't need no place to go
Remember at the prom that night
You and me, we had a fight
But the band, they played our favorite song
And I held you in my arms so strong[Pre-Chorus]
We danced so close, we danced so slow
And I swore I'd never let you go
Together forever
[Chorus]
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hopin' it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we've gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and I guess you'd say we used to talk
About bustin' out, we'd break their hearts
Together forever
[Chorus]
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hopin' it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Psychic spies from China try to steal your mind's elation
And little girls from Sweden dream of silver-screen quotation
And if you want these kind of dreams, it's Californication
[Verse 2]
It's the edge of the world and all of Western civilization
The sun may rise in the East, at least it settled in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood sells Californication
[Pre-Chorus]
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin: is this your chin or is that war you're waging?
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
[Verse 3]
Marry me, girl, be my fairy to the world, be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard, it's Californication
[Verse 4]
Space may be the final frontier but it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain, can you hear the spheres singing songs off 
Station to Station?
?
And Alderaan's not far away, it's Californication[Pre-Chorus]
Born and raised by those who praise control of population
Well, everybody's been there, and I don't mean on vacation
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 5]
Destruction leads to a very rough road but it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar, they're just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world from Californication
[Pre-Chorus]
Pay your surgeon very well to break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test, but this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hardcore soft porn
[Chorus]
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
Dream of Californication
[Verse 1]
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
[Verse 2]
Defunkt, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End
[Verse 3]
Knocked out, but, boy, you better come to
 (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth as some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
[Pre-Chorus 1]
White heat is screamin' in the jungle (Oh, oh-oh)
Complete the motion if you stumble (Oh-oh)
Go ask the dust for any answers (Oh-oh)
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers
[Chorus]
The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to[Verse 4]
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature
[Verse 5]
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation
[Verse 6]
This chapter's gonna be a close one (Oh, oh-oh)
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one (Oh-oh)
All on a spaceship, persevering (Oh-oh)
Use my hands for everything but steering
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Can't stop the spirits when they need you (Oh, oh-oh)
Mop tops are happy when they feed you (Oh-oh)
J. Butterfly is in the treetop (Oh-oh)
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop
[Chorus]
The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to[Bridge]
Wait a minute, I'm passin' out, win or lose
Just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew
How 'bout you?
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new
Just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew
Right on cue
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 1]
Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation

Knocked out, but boy, you better come to (Oh, oh-oh)
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do (Oh-oh)
Go write your message on the pavement (Oh-oh)
Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant[Verse 7]
Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering
[Verse 8]
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades
[Outro]
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through
[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, The City of Angels
Lonely as I am, together we cry
[Verse 2]
I drive on her streets 'cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills 'cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie
[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 3]
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love, the city she loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah, yeah
Love me, I say, yeah, yeah
(One time)
[Outro]
(Under the bridge downtown)
Is where I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown)
I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown)
Forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown)
I gave my life away, yeah
Yeah, yeah
(Away)
Oh, no, no no no, yeah yeah
(Away)
Oh no, I said, yeah yeah
(Away)
Where I'll stay
[Verse 1]
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share
[Chorus]
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
[Verse 2]
Ah, push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Ah, fallin' all over myself
To lick your heart and taste your health, 'cause
[Chorus]
With the birds (Share this lone—), I'll share this lonely view
With the birds (Share this lone—), I'll share this lonely view
With the birds (Share this lone—), I'll share this lonely view
[Verse 3]
Blood loss in a bathroom stall
A southern girl with a scarlet drawl
I wave good-bye to Ma and Pa
'Cause with the birds I'll share[Chorus]
With the birds (Share this lonely), I'll share this lonely view
With the birds (Share this lonely), I'll share this lonely view
[Verse 4]
Soft-spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet, we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and
[Chorus]
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
[Instrumental Break]
[Verse 1]
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you
'Cause with the birds I'll share[Chorus]
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
(I will share this lonely)
With the birds, I'll share this lonely view
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Well, separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
Slittin' my throat, it's all I ever
[Verse 1]
I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I gotta take it on the otherside
[Verse 2]
Well, centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
A stranger thing could never change my mind
I gotta take it on the otherside
[Pre-Chorus]
Take it on the otherside
Take it on, take it on
[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
A-separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
A-slittin' my throat, it's all I ever[Verse 3]
Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I'm spillin' my guts
She want to know am I still a slut?
I gotta take it on the otherside
[Verse 4]
A scarlet starlet and she's in my bed
A candidate for the soul mate bled
Mmm, push the trigger and I pull the thread
I gotta take it on the otherside
[Pre-Chorus]
Take it on the otherside
Take it on, take it on
[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
A-slittin' my throat, it's all I ever
[Instrumental Break]
[Bridge]
Turn me on, take me for a hard ride
Burn me out, leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that it's not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down, and then it's born again[Instrumental Break]
[Chorus]
How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don't, I don't believe it's bad
A-slittin' my throat, it's all I ever had
[Outro]
(How long?)
I don't, I don't believe it’s sad
A-slittin' my throat, is all I ever
[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone, come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe that we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice
[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your— Hey, oh
Now listen what I say, oh
(Oh)
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more time to decide on
When it's killing me, when will I really see
All that I need to look inside?
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside?[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
Come back and— Hey, oh
Look at what I say, oh
(Oh)
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey, oh! Whoa-whoa
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
And it's so
 white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's no
where to go
Ho
!
[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
When to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice[Refrain: Anthony Kiedis & John Frusciante]
Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
I got your— Hey, oh
Listen what I say, oh
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh, whoa-whoa
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so
 white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's no
where to go
[Bridge: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
(Uh-uh)
 
I said, hey— Hey, yeah
Oh, yeah!
 Tell my love now
(Uh-uh)
 
Hey— Hey, yeah
Oh, yeah!
 Tell my love now[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis with John Frusciante]
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so
 white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's no
where to go
[Outro: Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante]
(Uh-uh)
 
I said, hey— Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah!
 Tell my love now
(Uh-uh)
 
Hey— Hey, yeah
Oh, yeah!

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie
In Alabama, she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world does your company take me for?
[Verse 2: Anthony Kiedis]
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin', "Baby, what you gonna—?"
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah[Verse 3: Anthony Kiedis]
She's a lover, baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen her comin' when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
A little loaded, she was stealin' another breath
I love my baby to death
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah
[Bridge: John Frusciante]
Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say, say, say
[Verse 4: Anthony Kiedis]
Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a-gunnin' for the quota[Pre-Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
Down in the Badlands, she was savin' the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast
[Chorus: Anthony Kiedis]
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest, yeah, yeah
California, rest in peace (Do svidaniya)

[Chorus]
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, overload
[Verse 1]
Steak knife, card shark
Con job, boot cut
Skin that flick, she's such a little DJ
Get there quick by street but not the freeway
Turn that trick to make a little leeway
Beat that nic, but not the way that we play
Dogtown, blood bath
Rib cage, soft tail
[Chorus]
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
[Verse 2]
Black jack,
 
dope dick
Pawn shop, quick pick
Kiss that dyke, I know you want to hold one
Not on strike but I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic, I know you never stole one
Girls that like a story, so I told one
Song bird, main line
Cash back, hard top[Chorus]
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
[Bridge]
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah, guess you never meant it
Ooh, ah
[Chorus]
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani, the girl, is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, oversold
By the way, I tried to say
I know you from before[Outro]
Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
[Verse 1]
Comin' on to the light of day, we got
Many moons that are deep at play so I
Keep an eye on the shadow smile to see what it has to say
You and I both know, everything must go away
Ah, what do you say?
Spinnin' knot that is on my heart is like a
Bit of light in a touch of dark, you got
Sneak attack from the zodiac
 but I see your fire spark
Eat the breeze and go, 
blow by blow and go away
Oh, what do you say? Yeah
[Chorus]
You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design and
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design
[Verse 2]
Stumble down to the parking lot, you got
No time for the afterthought, they're like
Ice Cream for an Astronaut,
 
well, that's me looking for we
Turn the corner and find the world at your command
Playin' the hand, yeah
[Chorus]
You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky
Dark necessities are part of my design[Bridge]
Do you want this love of mine? Darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
Do you want it all the time? But darkness helps us all to shine
Do you want it, do you want it now?
[Verse 3]
Ah, pick you up like a paperback with the
Track record of a maniac so I
Move it in and we unpack, it's the same as yesterday
Any way we roll, everything must go away
Oh, what do you say? Yeah
[Chorus]
You don't know my mind, you don't know my kind
Dark necessities are part of my design
Tell the world that I'm falling from the sky and
Dark necessities are part of my design

What I got, you got to give it to your mamma
What I got, you've got to give it to your pappa
What I got, you got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I got, you got to get it put it in you
What I got, you got to get it put it in you
What I got, you got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the feeling, don't stop, continue
I realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with Sly, you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the Kaiser?
[Chorus]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper
[Verse 1]
Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free, love me, say, "Hell, yes"
Low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now
Bob Marley, poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walkin' like he talk it
Goodness me, can't you see I'm gonna cough it?[Chorus]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Oh, oh yeah
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper
[Backwards Guitar Solo]
[Verse 2]
Lucky me swimming in my ability
Dancing down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility
My mom, I love her 'cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feelin' good, my brother gonna hug me
Drinkin' my juice, young love chug-a-lug me
Ah, there's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is a never gonna wither
Come on, everybody, time to deliver[Chorus]
Give it away, give it away, give it away now
Give it away, give it away, give it away now

[Verse 1]
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special
[Chorus]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
[Verse 2]
I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around
[Pre-Chorus]
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special[Chorus]
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
Oh-oh, oh-oh
[Bridge]
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
[Outro]
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
[Verse 1]
A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
I'll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
[Chorus]
And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent
[Verse 2]
This is my final fit
My final bellyache with
[Chorus]
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
[Verse 3]
Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden[Chorus]
No alarms and no surprises
(Get me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises
(Get me out of here)
No alarms and no surprises, please
(Get me out of here)
[Verse 1]
Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
[Verse 2]
Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party
[Chorus]
This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
When you mess with us
[Verse 3]
Karma police, I've given all I can, it's not enough
I've given all I can, but we're still on the payroll
[Chorus]
This is what you get
This is what you get
This is what you get
When you mess with us[Outro]
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
[Verse 1]
Two jumps in a week, I bet you
Think that's pretty clever, don't you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
You'd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
You're turning into something you are not
[Chorus]
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
[Verse 2]
Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
They're the ones who'll hate you
When you think you've got the world all sussed out
They're the ones who'll spit at you
You will be the one screaming out[Chorus]
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Oh, it's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing that you've ever, ever had
It's the best thing that you've ever had
The best thing you've had has gone away
[Chorus]
So don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me high
Don't leave me dry
[Verse 1]
Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you've had too much
Come back in focus again
The walls are bending shape
They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose
[Verse 2]
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes 'round and 'round
The beat goes 'round and 'round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance[Chorus]
A jigsaw falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, and you look back
Not just once, and not just twice
Wish away your nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
You got the light, you can feel it on your back
A light, you can feel it on your back
Your jigsaw falling into place
[Verse 1]
Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape, we escape
[Verse 2]
Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose
[Verse 3]
Breathe, keep breathing
Don't lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I can't do this alone
[Verse 4]
Sing us a song
A song to keep us warm
There's such a chill
Such a chill
[Verse 5]
And you can laugh a spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace
We hope that you choke, that you choke[Outro]
We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke
[Verse 1]
A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In a fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plants
To get rid of itself
[Chorus]
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
[Verse 2]
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins
[Chorus]
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears[Verse 3]
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run
[Chorus]
And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
[Outro]
And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time
All the time
[Verse 1]
Can't get the stink off
He's been hanging 'round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends
[Pre-Chorus 1]
One day he'll get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow
[Chorus]
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
[Verse 2]
Don't get my sympathy
Hanging out the fifteenth floor
You've changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door
[Pre-Chorus 2]
One day I'll get to you
And teach you how to get to purest hell[Chorus]
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
You do it to yourself, you do
And that's why it really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Self
[Outro]
(You do it to yourself!)
(You do it to yourself!)
(Oh, you do it to yourself!)
(Oh, you do it to yourself!)
[Verse 1]
In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?
[Verse 2]
I'd be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me into phantoms (Way out)
I follow to the edge (Way out)
Of the earth (Way out)
And fall off
Yeah, everybody leaves (Way out)
If they get the chance (Way out)
And this (Way out)
Is my chance
[Chorus]
I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes[Instrumental Break]
[Outro]
Yeah, I
I hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
I
I hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
[Verse 1]
I'm the next act waiting in the wings
I'm an animal trapped in your hot car
I am all the days that you choose to ignore
[Chorus]
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
[Verse 2]
I am a moth who just wants to share your light
I'm just an insect trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you because there are no others
[Chorus]
You are all I need
You're all I need
I'm in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
[Outro]
It's all wrong, it's all wrong, it's all wrong
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's all wrong, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright

[Intro: Chester Bennington]
It starts with one
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, 
all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, 
it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to 
watch you go
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how 
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it 
got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me 
in the end
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
I don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Can't you see that you're smothering me?
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart, right in front of you
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow
And every second I waste is more than I can take[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
And I know
I may end up failing too
But I know
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I've said before
All these words, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before
[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts, they make no sense
I found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Just like before
[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up
Shut up when I'm talking to you
Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up
I'm about to break
[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break
Everything you say to me
Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
I need a little room to breathe
'Cause I'm one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
In this farewell
There's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth of a thousand lies
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So let mercy come and wash away
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
What I've done, I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington]
So let mercy come and wash away
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
What I've done, I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
For what I've done, I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving what I've
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Done, I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
[Outro: Mike Shinoda & Chester Bennington]
(Na-na na na, na-na na na)
(Na-na na na, na-na na na)
What I've done
(Na-na na na, na-na na na)
(Na-na na na, na-na na na)
Forgiving what I've done
(Na-na na na, na-na na na)
(Na-na na na, na-na na na)
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit of loneliness
A little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact
That everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want
What I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
To just believe this is real
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watchin' you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I am a little bit insecure
A little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand, I do what I can
But sometimes, I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say
But I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you
For once, just to hear me out[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
So I let go, watchin' you
Turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
No, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now, hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now
[Breakdown: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Yeah, here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Goin' out of my fuckin' mind
Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose
Truth is, you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out, laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere
Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in
[Chorus: Chester Bennington with Mike Shinoda]
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Go, stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera, lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go
Mama, help me, I've been cursed
Death is rollin' in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him, he knows he works
Fuck, this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied
So why try ignorin' him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this!
I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now!
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out, digging deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
I bleed it out, diggin' deeper just to throw it away
Just to throw it away, just to throw it away
I bleed it out
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I bleed it out
I bleed it out
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
(When this began) 
I had nothin' to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused) 
And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me) But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose) Just stuck, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington]
And I've got nothin' to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused) Lookin' everywhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?) What do I have but negativity?
'Cause I can't justify the way everyone is lookin' at me
(Nothing to lose) Nothin' to gain, hollow, and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today
[Chorus: Chester Bennington, Mike Shinoda]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong[Outro: Chester Bennington]
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm
Somewhere I belong
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm
Somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending
Controlling, I can't seem
[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
[Verse 2: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting (Distracting), reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection (My own reflection)
It's haunting (It's haunting) how I can't seem[Pre-Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
To find myself again, my walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before, so insecure
[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
(There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surfaceConsuming)
 
Confusing what is real
(This lack of self-control I fear is never-endingControlling)
 
Confusing what is real
[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin
[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside, too
And your paranoia's probably worse
I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can
[Pre-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)
So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watchin' you too
Right inside your skin
[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin
It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like 
the face inside is right beneath the skin[Post-Chorus: Mike Shinoda]
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
[Chorus: Chester Bennington & Mike Shinoda]
(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin (I feel the light betray me)
(The sun) It's like I'm paranoid, lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within (I feel the light betray me)
[Outro: Chester Bennington]
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearin' within
(It's like) It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin
[Intro: 50 Cent:]
Sh-sh-sh-shady
Aftermath, haha
G-G-G-G-G-Unit!, haha
[Chorus: Jay-Z & Linkin Park]
I've become so numb
Can I get an encore
Do you want more (more)
I've become so numb
Can I get an encore
Do you want more (more)
I've become so numb
Can I get an encore
Do you want more (more)
[Eminem]
Get your ass up for the doctor
One more time, get your ass up for the doctor
Come on now, here we go
Cliff hanger, it's another club banger
Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat
Get on down
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Times up, games over, you lose, I win
'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you goin' crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playin' the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin'
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond
World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'
[Chorus: Jay-Z & Linkin Park]
Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise
[Brigde: Eminem]
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time
When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk
Crunk, crunk, crunk
And when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
Jump, jump, jump, jump[Dr. Dre]
The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches
[Eminem]
We keep the party rockin' off the henges
We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus
[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off
Who the f*ck is Doc impressin'?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessin'
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what)
We gon' have this mutherf*cker hoppin' in a second (bump bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
[Verse 4: Eminem]
Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap
Maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages
Broke down barriers of language and races
Just call on the cape crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic
And we can play the back and forth all day
Like the hot potato game, that's why we came to[Bridge: Eminem]
First we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
[Chorus: Jay-Z & Linkin Park]
Now what the hell are you waitin for
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar
[Bridge: Linkin Park]
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take
[Chorus: Linkin Park & Jay-Z]
I've become so numb I can't feel you there
I've become so tired so much more aware
I'm becoming this all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb
Can I get an encore, do you want more (more...)
[50 Cent]
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
[Dr. Dre]
And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees
Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's
All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally
[Eminem]
Hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
[Dr. Dre]
You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker
[Eminem]
So never say never cause Shady Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better
We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh
[Chorus: Jay-Z & Linkin Park]
Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar
