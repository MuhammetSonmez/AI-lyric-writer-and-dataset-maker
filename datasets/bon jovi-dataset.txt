[Intro]
Once upon a time, not so long ago
[Verse 1]
Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike, he's down on his luck
It's tough
So tough
Gina works the diner all day
Workin' for her man, she brings home her pay
For love
Mm, for love
[Pre-Chorus]
She says, "We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot"
[Chorus]
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
[Verse 2]
Tommy's got his six-string in hock
Now he's holdin' in, 
when he used to make it talk
So tough
Ooh, it's tough
Gina dreams of runnin' away
When she cries in the night, Tommy whispers
"Baby, it's okay
Someday"[Pre-Chorus]
We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot for love
We'll give it a shot
[Chorus]
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand, we'll make it I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer, livin' on a prayer
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
Ooh, we gotta hold on, ready or not
You live for the fight when that's all that you've got
[Chorus]
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Woah, we're halfway there
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Woah-oh, livin' on a prayer
[Intro]
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
Darling, you give love a bad name
[Verse 1]
An angel's smile is what you sell
You promised me heaven, then put me through hell
Chains of love got a hold on me
When passion's a prison, you can't break free
[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, you're a loaded gun, yeah
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done
[Chorus]
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
Yeah, you give love a bad name
[Verse 2]
Paint your smile on your lips
Blood red nails on your fingertips
A school boy's dream, you act so shy
Your very first kiss was your first kiss goodbye[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, you're a loaded gun
Oh, there's nowhere to run
No one can save me, the damage is done
[Chorus]
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
You give love a—
[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Oh, shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
Shot through the heart and you're to blame
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
I play my part and you play your game
You give love a bad name (Bad name)
[Outro]
You give love
You give love, bad name
You give love
You give love, bad name
You give love
You give love, bad name
You give love
You give love, bad name
[Verse 1]
This ain't a song for the broken-hearted (woah oh, woah oh, oh)
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice when I shout it out loud
[Chorus]
It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
[Verse 2]
This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky, got to make your own breaks
[Chorus]
It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life[Bridge]
Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down
[Chorus]
It's my life, it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life) My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said, "I did it my way"
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life
[Verse 1]
This Romeo is bleeding
But you can't see his blood
It's nothing but some feelings
That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood
You see I've always been a fighter
But without you I give up
I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore
But baby, that's just me
[Chorus]
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always
[Verse 2]
Now your pictures that you left behind
Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him 'cause those words are mine
To say to you 'till the end of time[Chorus]
Yeah, I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
[Bridge]
If you told me to cry for you
I could
If you told me to die for you
I would
Take a look at my face
There's no price I won't pay
To say these words to you
[Guitar Solo]
Well, there ain't no luck
In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines
[Chorus]
And I will love you, baby, always
And I'll be there forever and a day, always
I'll be there till the stars don't shine
Till the heavens burst and
The words don't rhyme
And I know when I die, you'll be on my mind
And I'll love you, always
Always
[Verse 1]
It's all the same, only the names will change
Every day it seems we're wastin' away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home
[Chorus]
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
The people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone, well, all you do is think
[Chorus]
I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
Wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, and I ride[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
Ooh, I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
[Verse 3]
But I walk these streets, a loaded six-string on my back
I play for keeps 'cause I might not make it back
I've been everywhere, (Oh yeah) still I'm standin' tall
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all
[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse, I ride
I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
And I'm a cowboy
I got the night on my side
And I'm wanted (Wanted) dead or alive
[Outro]
And I ride (And I ride), dead or alive
I still drive (Still drive), dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
Dead or alive
[Verse 1]
On the street where you live girls talk about their social lives
They're made of lipstick, plastic and paint, a touch of sable in their eyes
(All your life) All your life all you've asked when's your daddy gonna talk to you
But you was living in another world trying to get your message through
[Pre-Chorus]
No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head
[Chorus]
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway
[Verse 2]
Take a line every night guaranteed to blow your mind
I see you out on the streets, calling for a wild time
So you sit home alone cause there's nothing left that you can do
There's only pictures hung in the shadows left there to look at you
You know she likes the lights at night on the neon Broadway signs
She don't really mind, it's only love she hoped to find
[Chorus]
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway[Guitar Solo]
[Pre-Chorus]
No one heard a single word you said
They should have seen it in your eyes
What was going around your head
[Chorus]
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy’s girl learned fast
Now she works the night away
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy's girl learned fast
All those things she couldn't say
Ooh, she's a little runaway
Daddy’s girl learned fast
Now she works the night away
Ooh, she's a little runaway
[Verse 1]
Sitting here wasted and wounded at this old piano
Trying hard to capture the moment this morning I don't know
'Cause 
a bottle of Vodka is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies they won't make of me when I'm dead
[Verse 2]
With an ironclad fist, I wake up and French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps its own beat in my head while we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and what you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need
[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I wanna be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses
[Verse 3]
Well I'm so far away, that each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby, blind love is true[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses
[Bridge]
Well, this hotel bar hangover whiskey's gone dry
The barkeeper's wig's crooked
And she's giving me the eye
I might have said yeah
But I laughed so hard I think I died
Ooh yeah
[Guitar solo]
[Verse 4]
Now as you close your eyes know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me
To stand in her spotlight again
Tonight, I won't be alone
But you know that don't mean I'm not lonely
I've got nothing to prove for it's you that I'd die to defend[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
[Chorus]
I want to lay you down in a bed of roses
For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
I want to be just as close as
The Holy Ghost is
And lay you down
On a bed of roses
[Chorus]
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad medicine)
[Verse 1]
I ain't got a fever got a permanent disease
It'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
And I got all the symptoms count them, one, two, three
[Pre-Chorus]
First you need (That's what you get for falling in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little but it's never enough)
On your knees (That's what you get for falling in love)
And now this boy's addicted cause your kiss is the drug
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
(Bad, bad medicine)[Verse 2]
I don't need no needle to be giving me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addiction, it doesn't leave a track
I've got a jones for your affection like a monkey on my back
There ain't no paramedic gonna save this heart attack
[Pre-Chorus]
When you need (That's what you get for falling in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little but it's never enough)
On your knees (That's what you get for falling in love)
Now this boy is addicted and your kiss is the drug
[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
So let's play doctor, baby, cure my disease
(Bad, bad medicine) That's what I want
(Bad, bad medicine) That's what I need
[Verse 3]
I need a respirator cause I'm running out of breath
You're an all night generator wrapped in stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine you take what you can get
'Cause if there's something better baby well they haven't found it yet[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease
Your love, bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up, just like bad medicine
Your love's the potion that can cure my disease
Bad, bad medicine is what I want
Bad, bad medicine (I gotta, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta)
[Breakdown]
I gotta, I gotta
I gotta do it again, wait a minute, wait a minute
Hold on
I'm not done
One more time
With feeling
Come on
Help me out now
[Chorus]
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need
Oh-oh-oh, shake it up just like bad medicine
You got the potion that can cure my disease
Your love, bad medicine
Your kiss is what I need
Your love, bad medicine
[Verse 1]
I guess this time you're really leavin'
I heard your suitcase say goodbye
Well, as my broken heart lies bleedin'
You say true love is suicide
You say you've cried a thousand rivers
And now you're swimmin' for the shore
You left me drownin' in my tears
And you won't save me anymore
I'm prayin' to God you'll give me one more chance, girl
[Chorus]
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe, I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you
[Verse 2]
I know you know we've had some good times
Now they have their own hidin' place
Well, I can promise you tomorrow
But I can't buy back yesterday
And, baby, you know my hands are dirty
(And baby, you know my hands are dirty)
But I wanted to be your Valentine
I'll be the water when you get thirsty, baby
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine[Chorus]
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you
[Guitar Solo]
[Bridge]
And I wasn't there when you were happy
(And I wasn't there to make you happy)
I wasn't there when you were down
I didn't mean to miss your birthday, baby
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out
[Chorus]
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, I'd steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you
When you breathe I want to be the air for you, I'll be there for you
I'd live and I'd die for you, steal the sun from the sky for you
Words can't say what love can do, I'll be there for you
[Outro]
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh-whoa
[Verse 1]
As I sit in this smoky room
The night about to end
I pass my time with strangers
But this bottle's my only friend
Rememberin' when we used to park
On Butler Street out in the dark
Remember when we lost the keys
And you lost more than that in my backseat, baby
[Pre-Chorus]
Remember how we used to talk
About bustin' out, we'd break their hearts
Together forever
[Chorus]
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hopin' it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we've gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
[Verse 2]
Remember days of skippin' school
Racin' cars and bein' cool
With a six-pack and the radio
We didn't need no place to go
Remember at the prom that night
You and me, we had a fight
But the band, they played our favorite song
And I held you in my arms so strong[Pre-Chorus]
We danced so close, we danced so slow
And I swore I'd never let you go
Together forever
[Chorus]
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hopin' it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we've gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, and I guess you'd say we used to talk
About bustin' out, we'd break their hearts
Together forever
[Chorus]
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hopin' it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on, we gotta try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye
Yeah, yeah
