[Verse 1]
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I'll wait for you
[Verse 2]
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I'll wait without you
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you
[Verse 3]
Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all, but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, ah-hah
I can't live
With or without you
[Refrain]
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away[Verse 4]
My hands are tied
My body bruised
She got me with
Nothing to win and nothing left to lose
[Refrain]
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, oh-oh
I can't live
With or without you
[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh
[Chorus]
With or without you
With or without you, oh-oh
I can't live with or without you
With or without you[Outro]
Hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh
Hoo-ooh-hoo-ooh
[Verse 1]
I have climbed highest mountain
I have run through the fields
Only to be with you
Only to be with you
I have run, I have crawled
I have scaled these city walls
These city walls
Only to be with you
[Chorus]
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
[Verse 2]
I have kissed honey lips
Felt the healing fingertips
It burned like fire
This burnin' desire
I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone
[Chorus]
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for[Interlude]
[Verse 3]
I believe in the Kingdom Come
Then all the colours will bleed into one
Bleed into one
But yes, I'm still runnin'
You broke the bonds and you loosened the chains
Carried the cross of my shame
Of my shame
You know I believe it
[Chorus]
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
But I still haven't found what I'm lookin' for
[Verse 1]
The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stony ground
There's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck, and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck, and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace
[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Sky falls, you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
[Verse 2]
You're on the road, but you've got no destination
You're in the mud
, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over, and it's been all over you
[Chorus]
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Ooh-hoo-hoo[Post-Chorus]
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case
[Bridge]
See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colours came out
[Chorus]
It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day
[Post-Chorus]
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case[Outro]
What you don't have you don't need it now
What you don't know you can feel it somehow
What you don't have you don't need it now
Don't need it now
Was a beautiful day
[Verse 1]
Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you
Now you got someone to blame?
[Chorus]
You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it
[Verse 2]
Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without
[Chorus]
Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One
[Verse 3]
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?[Chorus]
Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again
[Bridge]
You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt
[Chorus]
One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One
One
[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh
Baby, baby, baby
Higher
Oh, higher (Baby, yeah, yeah)
Higher (Oh)
Higher
Go to Sunday Bloody Sunday for music lyrics
[Intro]
Ooh ooh ooh
Yeah yeah yeah
[Verse 1]
My love, she throws me like a rubber ball
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
But she won't catch me or break my fall
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
Baby got blue skies up ahead
But in this, I'm a raincloud
You know she likes a dry kind of love
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
[Chorus]
I'm losin' you, yeah heh hey
I'm losin' you, yeah
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
[Verse 2]
I wanted to run but she made me crawl
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
Eternal fire, she turned me to straw
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
You know I got black eyes
But they burn so brightly for her
Mine is a blind kind of love
(Oh, the sweetest thing)[Chorus]
I'm losin' you, oh oh oh
I'm losin' you, yeah
Ain't love the sweetest thing?
[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
Oh ho, yeah
[Bridge]
Oh oh now now my baby
Um my my, um my baby
Um my my, um my baby
[Verse 3]
Blue-eyed boy and this brown-eyed girl
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
You can sew it up, but you still see the tear
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
Baby's got blue skies up ahead
And in this, I'm a raincloud
You know we got a stormy kind of love
(Oh, the sweetest thing)
[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, the sweetest thing
Oh, the sweetest thing
Oh, the sweetest thing
[Verse 1]
I'm not afraid
Of anything in this world
There's nothing you can throw at me
That I haven't already heard
I'm just trying to find
A decent melody
A song that I can sing
In my own company
[Pre-Chorus]
I never thought you were a fool
But darling look at you (Oh)
You gotta stand up straight
Carry your own weight
These tears are going nowhere, baby
[Chorus]
You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And now you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
[Verse 2]
I will not forsake
The colours that you bring
The nights you filled with fireworks
They left you with nothing
I am still enchanted
By the light you brought to me
I listen through your ears
Through your eyes I can see[Pre-Chorus]
And you are such a fool
To worry like you do (Oh, oh)
I know it's tough
And you can never get enough
Of what you don't really need now
My, oh my
[Chorus]
You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
Oh love, look at you now
You've got yourself stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
[Bridge]
I was unconscious, half-asleep
The water is warm till you discover how deep
I wasn't jumping, for me it was a fall
It's a long way down to nothing at all
[Chorus]
You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it[Outro]
And if the night runs over
And if the day won't last
And if our way should falter
Along the stony pass
And if the night runs over
And if the day won't last
And if your way should falter
Along the stony pass
It's just a moment
This time will pass
[Intro]
Unos, dos, tres, catorce!
(Turn it up loud, captain)
[Verse 1]
Lights go down, it's dark
The jungle is your head, can't rule your heart
A feeling so much stronger than a thought
Your eyes are wide
And though your soul, it can't be bought
Your mind can wander
[Chorus]
Hello, hello (¡Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (¿Dónde está?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something I can feel
Feel
[Verse 2]
The night is full of holes
As bullets rip the sky of ink with gold
They twinkle as the boys play rock and roll
They know that they can't dance
At least they know
I can't stand the beats, I'm asking for the cheque
The girl with crimson nails has Jesus round her neck
Swinging to the music, swinging to the music
Oh, oh, oh[Chorus]
Hello, hello (¡Hola!)
I'm at a place called Vertigo (¿Dónde está?)
It's everything I wish I didn't know
But you give me something I can feel
Feel
[Post-Chorus]
Checkmated!
Just fun!
She made it in, yeah!
[Bridge]
All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
Just give me what I want and no one gets hurt
[Chorus]
Hello, hello (¡Hola!)
We're at a place called Vertigo (¿Dónde está?)
Lights go down and all I know
Is that you give me something
I can feel your love teaching me how
Your love is teaching me how
How to kneel
Kneel[Outro]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
